00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:10,897
Street has for this year, next three years, so 60 billion, 66 and 70 on CapEx with a 10 billion spread between depreciation, which actually isn't that huge of a spread.

2
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:17,181
So depreciation is 50, 56, 61, that's 10 billion spread.

3
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:23,325
If you want to look at like a gap net income this year, next year, the year after, it's like 50, 60, 80.

4
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:28,228
I'm not sure how reliable that 80 is though.

5
00:00:28,248 --> 00:00:30,289
But like overall, it's kind of like

6
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:35,874
Maybe if you look at the 80, that's like maybe 25 times priced earnings in 2026.

7
00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:39,877
But, you know, this business is like inflecting on the margin front.

8
00:00:39,918 --> 00:00:41,259
So it doesn't.

9
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:44,641
And given that we have 95 cents, it just seems about in the zone for me.
