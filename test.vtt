Street has for this year, next three years, so 60 billion, 66 and 70 on CapEx with a 10 billion spread between depreciation, which actually isn't that huge of a spread.

00:10.937 --> 00:17.181
So depreciation is 50, 56, 61, that's 10 billion spread.

00:17.241 --> 00:23.325
If you want to look at like a gap net income this year, next year, the year after, it's like 50, 60, 80.

00:23.865 --> 00:28.228
I'm not sure how reliable that 80 is though.

00:28.248 --> 00:30.289
But like overall, it's kind of like

00:30.790 --> 00:35.874
Maybe if you look at the 80, that's like maybe 25 times priced earnings in 2026.

00:37.275 --> 00:39.877
But, you know, this business is like inflecting on the margin front.

00:39.918 --> 00:41.259
So it doesn't.

00:41.299 --> 00:44.641
And given that we have 95 cents, it just seems about in the zone for me.
