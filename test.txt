Street has for this year, next three years, so 60 billion, 66 and 70 on CapEx with a 10 billion spread between depreciation, which actually isn't that huge of a spread.
So depreciation is 50, 56, 61, that's 10 billion spread.
If you want to look at like a gap net income this year, next year, the year after, it's like 50, 60, 80.
I'm not sure how reliable that 80 is though.
But like overall, it's kind of like
Maybe if you look at the 80, that's like maybe 25 times priced earnings in 2026.
But, you know, this business is like inflecting on the margin front.
So it doesn't.
And given that we have 95 cents, it just seems about in the zone for me.
